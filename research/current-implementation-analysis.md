# Current Ban Chess Implementation Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals a complex but functional Ban Chess implementation with significant architectural challenges. The codebase shows evidence of multiple refactoring attempts and overlapping state management approaches that have resulted in a partially working system with several critical gaps compared to production chess platforms.

## 1. Current Game Flow and State Management

### Unified Store Architecture (Zustand)
**File**: `src/stores/unifiedGameStore.ts` (1,566 lines)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive state management with slices for Game, UI, and Network concerns
- Unified handling of both local and online games
- Rich computed values and selectors for performance optimization
- Extensive Ban Chess rule implementation with proper phase transitions

**Critical Issues:**
- **Local Game Broken**: Multiple missing function implementations (`getLocalPossibleMoves`, `isLocalMoveBanned`, etc.)
- **Circular Dependencies**: Some selectors create infinite loops
- **Overlapping Responsibilities**: Board orientation handled in both store AND component state
- **State Synchronization Conflicts**: React Query cache vs Zustand store conflicts

**Implementation Quality**: 
- Ban Chess logic is sophisticated and mostly correct
- Checkmate detection properly implemented for Ban Chess variant
- Phase management (`selecting_ban` → `making_move`) works for online games

## 2. Real-time Synchronization Approach

### Supabase Realtime + React Query
**Files**: `src/hooks/useGameQueries.ts`, `src/services/gameService.ts`

**Current Approach:**
- Supabase realtime broadcasts for game updates
- React Query for caching and optimistic updates
- Server-side edge functions handle all game logic

**Performance Problems Identified:**
- **Double Updates**: Both broadcasts AND query invalidations trigger updates
- **Excessive Refetching**: Short cache times (30s) cause constant background requests
- **Timeout Delays**: 1.2s delays before confirming optimistic updates
- **Cascading Invalidations**: React Query invalidations trigger more invalidations

**Recent Fixes Applied (2025-08-16):**
- Increased cache stale time to 5 minutes
- Reduced redundant query invalidations
- Removed unnecessary timeout delays

## 3. Move and Ban Mechanics Implementation

### Core Logic Implementation
**Quality**: ✅ **Very Good** - Ban Chess rules properly implemented

**Working Features:**
- Move validation respects banned moves
- Phase transitions (ban → move → ban) work correctly
- Ban Chess checkmate detection (king in check + only 1 legal move → ban that move = checkmate)
- PGN generation includes ban comments
- Move history tracks both moves and bans

**Test Results**: 5/6 core Ban Chess tests passing (from CLAUDE.md)

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Castling detection and logging
- Pawn promotion support
- Standard chess rules (stalemate, insufficient material, etc.)

## 4. UI Components Structure

### Board Components
**File**: `src/components/GameBoardV2.tsx`
- Lightweight wrapper around LichessBoardV2
- Resizable board with localStorage persistence
- Game over overlay system

### Move History System
**File**: `src/components/GamePanel.tsx` (500+ lines)
- Database-driven move history (replaced PGN parsing)
- Sophisticated navigation with half-move granularity
- Ban move visualization with special formatting
- Performance optimized with direct database queries

**Recent Fix (2025-08-16)**: 
- Fixed ban moves not appearing in move list
- Added immediate database insertion for ban records
- Eliminated PGN parsing in favor of structured queries

### Missing UI Components
- **No piece drag preview**
- **No move animations** (mentioned but not implemented)
- **No clock/timer display** (time control exists in types but not UI)
- **No spectator mode UI**
- **No analysis mode**

## 5. Server-side Logic (Edge Functions)

### Game Handlers
**File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/game-handlers.ts`

**Architecture Quality**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Comprehensive operation routing
- Proper validation and error handling
- Database transactions for consistency
- Clock management integration
- Event logging system

**Supported Operations:**
- makeMove, banMove, resign
- Draw offers/accept/decline
- Rematch system
- Player disconnection handling
- Abandonment detection

## 6. Database Schema and RLS Policies

### Schema Quality: ✅ **Good**
- Proper enumeration types for game states
- UUID-based game IDs with 8-character short IDs
- Comprehensive move tracking with ban information
- Player profiles with username management

### Recent RLS Fixes (2025-08-16):
- Resolved "permission denied" errors
- Clean policy separation by role (service_role, authenticated, anon)
- Proper function grants and permissions

**Potential Issues:**
- Complex function overloads may cause confusion
- Some legacy UUID handling remnants

## 7. Current Known Issues (Critical)

### Stability Warning from CLAUDE.md:
> **The codebase is currently unstable** with ongoing fixes that may introduce new issues.

### Active Issues:
1. **Local Game Completely Broken** - Missing function implementations
2. **Board Orientation Double-Flip Bug** - Recently fixed but may have edge cases
3. **Performance Degradation** - Move sync takes too long, everything laggy
4. **Move List Auto-Navigation Conflict** - Interferes with game review

### Pattern of Problems:
Most issues stem from **overlapping responsibility** where multiple systems try to solve the same problem:
- Board orientation in both store AND components
- Data sync through both React Query AND realtime broadcasts
- Move tracking through both auto-navigation AND user interaction

## 8. Performance Bottlenecks

### Identified Issues:
1. **React Query Conflicts**: Cache invalidations cause cascading refetches
2. **Optimistic Update Delays**: 1.2s timeouts before confirmation
3. **Short Cache Times**: 30s stale time causes frequent background requests
4. **State Update Storms**: Multiple systems updating simultaneously

### Recent Optimizations:
- Increased cache stale time to 5 minutes
- Removed unnecessary delays
- Optimized query invalidation strategy

### Remaining Concerns:
- Potential memory leaks from subscriptions
- Component re-renders from non-optimized selectors

## 9. User Experience Pain Points

### Major UX Issues:
1. **No Visual Feedback**: No move highlights, piece drag preview, or animations
2. **Poor Navigation**: Move list jumping interferes with game analysis
3. **Missing Standard Features**: No clock display, no spectator mode, no analysis
4. **Broken Local Games**: Single-player mode completely non-functional
5. **Inconsistent State**: UI sometimes shows conflicting information

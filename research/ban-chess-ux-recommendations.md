# Ban Chess UX Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive UX recommendations for optimizing the Ban Chess variant based on analysis of successful chess variant patterns (particularly from lichess), accessibility best practices, and the unique requirements of the ban mechanic. The recommendations focus on making the ban phase intuitive, ensuring clear turn flow visualization, and creating an engaging spectator experience.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation
- **Unified Store Architecture**: Single source of truth for game state
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Optimistic updates with server confirmation
- **Visual Ban Indicators**: Red arrows show banned moves on the board
- **Phase-aware UI**: Different board behavior during ban vs move phases
- **Move History Integration**: Bans are displayed inline with moves
- **Sound Feedback**: Distinct audio cues for different actions

### Areas for Improvement
- **Ban Selection UX**: Could be more intuitive and discoverable
- **Time Allocation**: No specific timing strategy for ban phase
- **Spectator Understanding**: Complex for newcomers to follow
- **Mobile Experience**: Not optimized for smaller screens
- **Accessibility**: Limited support for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## 1. Ban Move Visualization Recommendations

### Primary Visual System
```typescript
// Enhanced ban visualization system
interface BanVisualization {
  preview: "hover-highlight" | "ghost-arrow" | "red-overlay";
  confirmation: "animated-arrow" | "crossed-out-square" | "ban-icon";
  history: "inline-display" | "separate-track" | "combined-notation";
}
```

**Recommended Implementation:**
- **Hover Preview**: Ghost red arrow appears when hovering over legal moves during ban phase
- **Selection Feedback**: Clicked squares get red overlay with pulsing border
- **Confirmation Animation**: Smooth animation drawing the red arrow with sound
- **Persistent Display**: Banned move shows as crossed-out square with red X overlay

### Secondary Visual Indicators
- **Board Border**: Subtle red glow around board during ban phase
- **Piece Highlighting**: Opponent pieces glow slightly during ban selection
- **Move Validation**: Attempted banned moves show brief red flash with rejection sound

## 2. Turn Flow Visualization

### Phase Transition System
```typescript
interface PhaseTransition {
  current: "selecting_ban" | "making_move" | "waiting";
  visual: "progress_bar" | "phase_indicator" | "timer_color";
  audio: "phase_change_sound" | "countdown_tick" | "warning_chime";
}
```

**Recommended Flow:**
1. **Ban Phase Start**: 
   - Animated banner: "Black to ban White's move"
   - Board border turns red
   - Only opponent pieces become draggable
   - 15-30 second countdown timer

2. **Ban Confirmation**:
   - Arrow animation with sound
   - Banner updates: "e2-e4 banned!"
   - Brief pause (2-3 seconds) for visual confirmation

3. **Move Phase Start**:
   - Banner transitions: "White to move"
   - Board border returns to normal
   - Own pieces become draggable
   - Main timer resumes

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Beginner Mode**: More verbose descriptions and hints
- **Expert Mode**: Minimal text, rely on visual cues
- **Tutorial Integration**: Interactive overlays for first-time players

## 3. Time Allocation Strategy

### Dual-Timer System
```typescript
interface BanChessTimeControl {
  mainTime: number;      // Primary game time
  banTime: number;       // Fixed time per ban (15-30 seconds)
  increment: number;     // Fischer increment per move
  banIncrement: number;  // Smaller increment per ban (5-10 seconds)
}
```

**Recommended Time Controls:**
- **Blitz (3+2)**: 3 minutes + 2 seconds/move + 15 seconds/ban + 5 seconds/ban
- **Rapid (10+5)**: 10 minutes + 5 seconds/move + 30 seconds/ban + 10 seconds/ban
- **Classical (30+30)**: 30 minutes + 30 seconds/move + 60 seconds/ban + 15 seconds/ban

### Visual Timer Design
- **Dual Display**: Main timer prominent, ban timer smaller
- **Color Coding**: Red for ban phase, normal color for move phase
- **Progress Indicators**: Circular progress bar for ban time
- **Low Time Warnings**: Different thresholds for ban vs move time

## 4. UI Feedback for Ban Selection

### Interactive Selection Process
```typescript
interface BanSelectionUI {
  step1: "click_source_square";
  step2: "show_possible_targets";
  step3: "click_target_square";
  step4: "confirm_ban";
  feedback: "haptic" | "visual" | "audio";
}
```

**Enhanced Selection Flow:**
1. **Source Selection**: Click piece → highlights all possible moves
2. **Target Preview**: Hover over destination → shows ghost ban arrow
3. **Ban Confirmation**: Click destination → confirmation dialog (optional)
4. **Execution**: Animated arrow placement with sound

### Alternative Input Methods
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag opponent piece to show ban preview
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through legal moves, Enter to ban
- **Notation Input**: Type move in standard notation (e.g., "ban e2e4")
- **Quick Ban**: Right-click move in move list to ban instantly

## 5. Move Preview with Ban Restrictions

### Enhanced Legal Move Display
```typescript
interface MovePreview {
  legalMoves: Square[];
  bannedMoves: Square[];
  conditionalMoves: Square[]; // Legal if different ban applied
  displayMode: "overlay" | "highlight" | "dim_illegal";
}
```

**Visual Strategy:**
- **Legal Moves**: Standard green dots and highlights
- **Banned Moves**: Red X overlay, no interaction possible
- **Conditional Moves**: Yellow outline (would be legal with different ban)
- **Piece Constraints**: Dim pieces that have no legal moves

### Smart Move Suggestions
- **Threat Analysis**: Highlight moves that create threats
- **Defense Indicators**: Show moves that defend against threats
- **Tactical Hints**: Subtle indicators for tactical opportunities
- **Ban Strategy**: AI suggestions for effective bans (optional setting)

## 6. Clear Turn Indication System

### Multi-Modal Turn Indicators
```typescript
interface TurnIndicator {
  primary: "player_name_highlight" | "board_orientation" | "timer_glow";
  secondary: "phase_banner" | "instruction_text" | "progress_bar";
  accessibility: "screen_reader" | "high_contrast" | "keyboard_focus";
}
```

**Comprehensive Indicator System:**
- **Player Panel**: Active player name glows with phase-appropriate color
- **Board Indicators**: Subtle arrows pointing to active side
- **Center Banner**: "White to move" / "Black to ban" with icons
- **Timer Animation**: Pulsing effect on active player's clock
- **Notification System**: Toast messages for phase changes

### Status Message Examples
- "Black is selecting a move to ban..." (with loading animation)
- "e2-e4 banned! White to move." (with confirmation checkmark)
- "Your turn to ban an opponent move" (for active player)
- "Waiting for opponent to ban..." (for inactive player)

## 7. History Display for Bans and Moves

### Integrated Move List Design
```typescript
interface MoveHistoryDisplay {
  layout: "traditional_table" | "timeline_view" | "card_based";
  banDisplay: "inline_with_moves" | "separate_column" | "icon_overlay";
  navigation: "half_move_precision" | "full_move_only" | "phase_aware";
}
```

**Recommended Layout:**
```
Move# | White      | Black
------|------------|----------
1.    | ⛔e2e4 e4   | ⛔Nf6 Nf6
2.    | ⛔d4 d4     | ⛔exd4 exd4
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Ban Notation**: Red ban icon (⛔) before affected move
- **Phase Navigation**: Click ban to see position after ban but before move
- **Hover Effects**: Show ban preview when hovering over ban notation
- **Filtering Options**: Show only moves, only bans, or both
- **Export Format**: PGN extension with ban annotations

### Timeline View Alternative
- **Horizontal Timeline**: Alternating moves and bans
- **Branching Display**: Show banned alternatives as greyed-out branches
- **Interactive Playback**: Slider to navigate through game phases
- **Annotation Support**: Comments and analysis at any position

## 8. Spectator Understanding

### Onboarding for New Viewers

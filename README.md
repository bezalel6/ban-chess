# ♟️ Ban Chess Web

An experimental **online platform for playing Ban Chess**, a chess variant where players alternate between banning opponent moves and making their own moves. 

> 📖 **For complete game rules, see [RULES.md](./RULES.md)** - the canonical ruleset for Ban-Chess.

Built with:

- [Next.js 15.5.2 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) — UI & routing with React 19
- [@bezalel6/react-chessground](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bezalel6/react-chessground) — interactive chessboard
- [ban-chess.ts v3.0.0](https://github.com/bezalel6/ban-chess.ts) — variant engine
- [WebSockets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) — real-time sync between players
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) — authentication with Google, Lichess & Guest login

This platform features comprehensive authentication, real-time multiplayer, sound effects, and extensive testing.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bezalel6/2ban-2chess.git
cd 2ban-2chess
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Servers

**Recommended approach:** Run each server in a separate terminal for better log insight and debugging.

**Terminal 1: WebSocket Server**
```bash
npm run dev:ws
```
This starts the WebSocket server on **ws://localhost:3001** with hot reload.

**Terminal 2: Next.js Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev:next
```
This starts the Next.js app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Alternative: Single Command** *(less optimal for debugging)*
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs both servers concurrently, but logs are mixed and harder to analyze.

> 📖 **For detailed development setup, debugging tips, and best practices, see [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**

### 3. Authentication Setup (Optional)

For OAuth providers, set up environment variables:

```bash
# Google OAuth (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Lichess OAuth (optional) 
LICHESS_CLIENT_ID=your_lichess_client_id

# NextAuth secret (required for production)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret

# WebSocket URL (auto-detected in development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3001
```

> 📖 **For detailed OAuth setup instructions, see [docs/OAUTH_SETUP.md](./docs/OAUTH_SETUP.md)**

### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

```bash
# Run E2E tests with Playwright
npm run test

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Run both type-check and lint
npm run analyze
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Visit the app**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. **Sign in**: Choose from Google OAuth, Lichess OAuth, or Guest mode
3. **Create/Join game**: 
   - **Solo Practice**: Click "Play Local" for single-player against the engine
   - **Online Multiplayer**: Click "Play Online" to create a game room
4. **Share game**: Copy the URL and share with an opponent for multiplayer
5. **Play the game**:
   - **Black bans first** - the game starts with Black banning a White move
   - If it's your turn to **ban**, select an opponent's piece to disable their moves
   - If it's your turn to **move**, make a legal move on the board (cannot use banned moves)
   - Turn order: Black bans → White moves → White bans → Black moves → repeat
6. **Game features**: Real-time sync, sound effects, move history, and timer support

> See [RULES.md](./RULES.md) for detailed game rules, special move handling, and edge cases.

## 📡 WebSocket Protocol

### ban-chess.ts Type Definitions

The game uses the following TypeScript types from the ban-chess.ts library:

```ts
interface Move {
  from: string;
  to: string;
  promotion?: 'q' | 'r' | 'b' | 'n';
}

interface Ban {
  from: string;
  to: string;
}

type Action = 
  | { move: Move }
  | { ban: Ban };

interface ActionResult {
  success: boolean;
  action?: Action;
  san?: string;
  error?: string;
  newFen?: string;
  gameOver?: boolean;
  checkmate?: boolean;
  stalemate?: boolean;
}

interface HistoryEntry {
  turnNumber: number;
  player: 'white' | 'black';
  actionType: 'ban' | 'move';
  action: Ban | Move;
  san?: string;
  fen: string;
  bannedMove?: Ban;
}
```

### Client → Server messages

```ts
type ClientMsg =
  | { type: "create"; gameId: string }
  | { type: "join"; gameId: string }
  | { type: "ban"; gameId: string; ban: Ban }
  | { type: "move"; gameId: string; move: Move };
```

### Server → Client messages

```ts
type ServerMsg =
  | { 
      type: "state"; 
      fen: string; 
      pgn: string; 
      nextAction: "ban" | "move"; 
      legalMoves?: Move[]; 
      legalBans?: Ban[];
      history?: HistoryEntry[];
    }
  | { type: "error"; message: string; error?: string };
```

## 🖼️ Board UI

The board is rendered using [react-chessground](https://github.com/ruilisi/react-chessground):

* `fen`: current position
* `movable.dests`: built from `legalMoves` or `legalBans`
* `onMove`: sends `{ type: "move" }` or `{ type: "ban" }` to server

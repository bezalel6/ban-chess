# Database and Edge Function Refactoring

## Overview

This project has been refactored to move complex functionality from database triggers and functions to Supabase Edge Functions. This architectural change provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Database Schema**: The database now focuses on data storage rather than complex business logic
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Logic is now in TypeScript code instead of SQL functions
3. **Improved Testability**: Edge functions are easier to test than database triggers
4. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Business logic can be updated without database migrations
5. **Better Error Handling**: More robust error management in TypeScript compared to PL/pgSQL

## Key Changes

### Removed from Database

The following functionality was removed from the database:

- `generate_short_id()` function → Now in edge functions
- `handle_new_user()` function and trigger → Now in user-management edge function
- `match_players()` function and trigger → Now in matchmaking edge function
- `notify_game_change()` function and trigger → Now in game-operations edge function

### Added to Edge Functions

New or updated edge functions:

1. **user-management**: Handles new user creation and profile management
2. **matchmaking**: Enhanced to handle player matching without database triggers
3. **game-operations**: Updated to handle game notifications and ID generation

### Added Event Logging

A new `event_log` table was added to track all important operations:

- User registration
- Profile updates
- Matchmaking events
- Game state changes

This provides better audit trails and debugging capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The new architecture follows these principles:

1. **Database is for Storage**: Database focuses on storing data with appropriate constraints and indexes
2. **Edge Functions for Logic**: Business logic is implemented in TypeScript edge functions
3. **Event-Based Design**: Operations are logged to the event_log table for auditing and potential event sourcing
4. **Clear Separation**: Each edge function has a specific purpose and domain of responsibility

## Migration Notes

This refactoring requires configuring webhooks for:

1. Auth events to trigger user profile creation
2. Database change events (if needed for notifications)
3. Setting up CRON jobs for periodic operations like queue processing

## Configuration Requirements

For this refactoring to work properly, make sure to:

1. Set up an Auth webhook that calls the `user-management` function on user creation
2. Configure the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable for secure cron job execution
3. Set up the `AUTH_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for secure auth webhook handling

## Testing

All refactored functionality should be thoroughly tested. Test scenarios should include:

1. User registration and profile creation
2. Matchmaking and game creation
3. Game operations and notifications
4. Error handling and edge cases

# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
Real-time multiplayer chess with Ban Chess variant - Black bans one of White's moves before every turn.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15.4 (Pages Router) + TypeScript
- React 19.1 + React DOM 19.1
- Supabase (database, auth, realtime)
- Material-UI 5.15 + Framer Motion 12
- Chess.ts 0.16 for game logic
- Zustand 5.0 for state management

## Dependencies
- bad-words: Profanity filtering for username validation
- the-big-username-blacklist: Comprehensive username blacklist validation

## Ban Chess Rules
1. Black bans one of White's possible first moves
2. White makes first move (avoiding the ban)  
3. White bans one of Black's possible moves
4. Black makes their move (avoiding the ban)
5. Pattern continues: After each move, the player who just moved bans opponent's next move

**Checkmate in Ban Chess**: A player is checkmated when their king is in check and they have only one legal move available (which the opponent can ban), resulting in no legal moves to escape check.

## Key Files
- `src/services/gameService.ts` - Game operations
- `src/stores/unifiedGameStore.ts` - State management (Zustand)
- `src/components/GameBoardV2.tsx` - Board UI
- `supabase/functions/_shared/game-handlers.ts` - Server logic

## Development
```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server (uses remote production Supabase instance)
npm run dev:local # Start dev server with local Supabase (for local development)
```
> **Note:** Use **npm** for all scripts—**bun** is no longer supported.

## Testing

### Playwright E2E Tests
End-to-end tests for Ban Chess gameplay using Playwright.

**Configuration Updates (2025-08-15)**:
- Fixed ES module compatibility issue (`__filename` → `import.meta.url` in `next.config.js`)
- Enabled parallel test execution with isolated workers to prevent browser context conflicts
- Tests run in 4 parallel workers locally (2 on CI) for better isolation

**Available Test Scripts**:
```bash
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with Playwright UI
npm run test:debug    # Run tests with debug mode and headed browser
npm run test:headed   # Run tests in headed mode
```

**Test Files**:
- `tests/e2e/ban-chess.spec.ts` - Ban Chess gameplay tests including:
  - Checkmate scenarios
  - Turn mechanics validation
  - Move and ban flow testing

### Logic Test Suite (`/test/logic-test`)
Comprehensive test suite for Ban Chess game logic with automated testing framework.

**Test Status (as of 2025-08-15): 5/6 Core Tests Passing ✅**

**Ban Chess Core Tests (All Passing):**
- ✅ **Basic Ban Test** - Tests ban operations (PASSING)
- ✅ **Basic Move Validation** - Tests move execution after bans (PASSING)
- ✅ **Ban Mechanism Test** - Tests the ban chess variant rules (PASSING)
- ✅ **Illegal Move Prevention** - Tests illegal move rejection (PASSING - fixed test verification)
- ✅ **Ban Chess Checkmate Detection** - Tests checkmate when king in check with only 1 legal move (PASSING - implemented 2025-08-15)

**Standard Chess Tests (Not Critical for Ban Chess MVP):**
- ❌ **Castling Rights Test** - Tests castling mechanics (FAILING - standard chess feature)
- ⏸️ **En Passant Capture** - Tests en passant special move (NOT YET TESTED)
- ⏸️ **Pawn Promotion** - Tests pawn promotion mechanics (NOT YET TESTED)
- ⏸️ **Checkmate Detection** - Tests checkmate detection (NOT YET TESTED)
- ⏸️ **Stalemate Detection** - Tests stalemate detection (NOT YET TESTED)
- ⏸️ **Sequential Ban Test** - Tests multiple bans in sequence (NOT YET TESTED)
- ⏸️ **Performance Stress Test** - Tests rapid operations (NOT YET TESTED)

**Key Fixes Applied:**
1. **chess.ts Method Compatibility**: Changed deprecated methods (`loadFen()` → `load()`, `isCheckmate()` → `inCheckmate()`)
2. **State Synchronization**: Tests now use `useUnifiedGameStore.getState()` directly for real-time state access instead of React hook values
3. **Initial Game State**: `initLocalGame()` correctly sets phase to `'selecting_ban'` for Ban Chess variant
4. **Phantom Property References**: Removed references to non-existent store properties (localCurrentPlayer, localBannedMove, localPhase)
5. **Test Setup Encapsulation**: Added `setupTestPosition` method for proper test setup without direct state manipulation
6. **Test Verification Fix**: Fixed "Illegal Move Prevention" test by removing incorrect verification step

**Running Tests:**
1. Navigate to `/test/logic-test` in browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" or run individual tests
3. View real-time test logs and results in the UI

### Testing Online Games
To test online game functionality:
1. Agent will launch `http://localhost:3000` in the browser
2. User will manually set up the game to the desired position/state
3. User will notify the agent when ready for testing
4. Agent can then interact with and debug the game

This approach gives the user full control over the game setup for testing.

## Important Notes
- TypeScript strict mode disabled
- Supabase is source of truth
- Move/ban validation happens server-side

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### Available Agents
Claude Code includes specialized agents for different tasks. Use these agents proactively:

1. **general-purpose**: Complex multi-step tasks, file searches, research
2. **quality-control-enforcer**: Code review, validation, ensuring best practices  
3. **claude-md-checker**: Verify adherence to CLAUDE.md guidelines
4. **banchess-grandmaster**: Ban Chess rules, game logic, move validation
5. **dev-culture-mentor**: Pragmatic code reviews, architecture discussions
6. **playwright-automation-executor**: Browser automation, E2E testing, web scraping

### Agent Usage Rules

#### Quality Control Integration
- **MANDATORY**: End every todo list with claude-md-checker verification
- **MANDATORY**: Use quality-control-enforcer at feature completion
- **MANDATORY**: Use quality-control-enforcer when user suspects quality issues

#### Ban Chess Expertise  
- Use banchess-grandmaster for ANY Ban Chess rule questions
- Use banchess-grandmaster to validate Ban Chess game logic implementations
- Use banchess-grandmaster for edge cases in ban mechanics

#### Development Workflow
1. Start complex tasks with general-purpose agent for research/planning
2. Implement features following project conventions
3. Use quality-control-enforcer to review implementation
4. Use claude-md-checker to verify CLAUDE.md compliance
5. Use playwright-automation-executor for E2E test validation

#### Example Todo List Structure
```
1. Research existing implementation
2. Design new feature architecture  
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add tests and error handling
5. Use quality-control-enforcer to review implementation
6. Use claude-md-checker to verify CLAUDE.md compliance
```

This ensures every feature meets quality standards and follows project guidelines.

## Performance Optimizations

### Webpack Cache Configuration (2025-01-15)
**Issue**: Development server showing webpack cache serialization warnings for large strings (128kiB+)
```
[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Serializing big strings impacts deserialization performance
```

**Solution**: Added custom webpack cache configuration in `next.config.js`:
- Enabled gzip compression for cache entries
- Set `maxMemoryGenerations: 1` to reduce memory overhead  
- Uses 'pack' store strategy for efficient serialization
- Applied only to client-side development builds

This eliminates the serialization warnings and improves dev server performance.

## Next.js 15.4 Upgrade Notes (2025-08-15)

### Current Version
The project has been upgraded from Next.js 14 to Next.js 15.4.6, maintaining full compatibility with the Pages Router architecture.

### Recommended Optimizations (Not Yet Implemented)

#### Bundle Optimization
**To implement**: Add to `next.config.js` experimental section:
```javascript
experimental: {
  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true
}
```
**Expected benefits**: 
- Improved cold-start performance for Supabase edge functions
- Better tree-shaking for Material-UI components
- Reduced bundle size for faster page loads

#### Optional Security Headers Enhancement
**To consider**: Additional security headers beyond current CSP:
```javascript
// In next.config.js headers() - evaluate before adding
{
  key: 'X-Frame-Options',
  value: 'SAMEORIGIN'
},
{
  key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
  value: 'nosniff'
},
{
  key: 'Referrer-Policy',
  value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'
}
```

#### Development Debugging (Optional)
**To test**: Enhanced debugging for development:
```javascript
experimental: {
  clientRouterFilter: true // Better error messages in dev mode
}
```
**Note**: Test with custom server setup before implementing.

### Important: Features to Avoid with Next.js 15.4
- **Turbopack**: Incompatible with custom server setup (`tsx src/server/server.ts`)
- **Dynamic IO**: Unnecessary - Supabase handles all real-time features
- **Server Actions**: Not available for Pages Router (App Router only)
- **Static Generation Optimizations**: Not beneficial for real-time multiplayer games
- **App Router Migration**: Keep Pages Router for stability with current architecture

## Supabase Troubleshooting Playbook (2025-08-16)

These are hard‑won lessons from fixing type mismatches, broken migrations, and resets. Follow in order.

- Connectivity and URLs
  - Prefer Session Pooler on 5432 for IPv4: aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com
  - Direct DB (…db.supabase.co:5432) is IPv6; only use if your env supports it
  - Always URL‑encode DB passwords when used in a URL. Example (Node):
    - DB_PASS_ENC=$(node -e "process.stdout.write(encodeURIComponent(process.env.SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD||''))")
  - Service role key is NOT a DB password

- Backups before destructive ops
  - Snapshot with pg_dump (works over pooler):
    - PGPASSWORD="$SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD" pg_dump "host=<pooler-host> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=postgres.<project-ref> sslmode=require" -Fc -f backups/remote_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump
  - If CLI/host is flaky, export CSVs per table from Studio

- Resets
  - Most reliable: Studio > Settings (gear) > Database > Danger Zone > Reset Database
  - CLI fallback: npx supabase@beta db reset --linked --no-seed
  - If you see “must be owner of sequence …”, use Studio reset or change owner first:
    - ALTER SEQUENCE auth.refresh_tokens_id_seq OWNER TO postgres; ALTER TABLE auth.refresh_tokens OWNER TO postgres;

- Migration history drift
  - Check: supabase migration list
  - If local and remote diverge, either pull (supabase db pull) or repair specific versions:
    - supabase migration repair --status reverted <version>
    - supabase migration repair --status applied <version>
  - If duplicate keys block repair, inspect and delete from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations explicitly (only if you know what you’re doing)

- Avoid ambiguous GRANTs with overloaded functions
  - Never: GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION handle_player_disconnect TO …
  - Do: grant per signature or loop over pg_proc. Example used in migrations:
    - DO $$ DECLARE r record; BEGIN FOR r IN (
      SELECT p.oid::regprocedure AS sig FROM pg_proc p JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid=p.pronamespace
      WHERE n.nspname='public' AND p.proname IN ('handle_player_disconnect','handle_player_reconnect','claim_abandonment','calculate_disconnect_allowance') )
      LOOP EXECUTE format('GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION %s TO authenticated, service_role', r.sig); END LOOP; END $$;

- Handling short game IDs vs UUIDs
  - Our app uses 8‑char alphanumeric game IDs; DB had legacy UUID expectations
  - Pattern that works:
    - Create text/uuid primary function: handle_player_reconnect(game_id text, player_id uuid)
    - Add text/text shim that casts player_id (safe_uuid_cast)
    - Do the same for handle_player_disconnect and claim_abandonment
  - Add a validate_game_id(text) helper and use triggers to enforce on INSERT/UPDATE; avoid strict CHECK if legacy rows exist (add conditionally)

- Defensive utilities
  - safe_uuid_cast(text) RETURNS uuid (returns NULL on failure)
  - validate_game_id(text) RETURNS boolean (accepts 8‑char or UUID for legacy)

- Conditional constraints to avoid blocking deploys
  - Only add games.id CHECK if all current rows match:
    - DO $$ BEGIN IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM games WHERE id !~ '^[A-Za-z0-9]{8}$') THEN
      ALTER TABLE games ADD CONSTRAINT games_id_format_check CHECK (id ~ '^[A-Za-z0-9]{8}$');
      ELSE RAISE NOTICE 'Skipping games_id_format_check: existing rows violate format'; END IF; END $$;

- Overloads inventory (post‑fix expected)
  - handle_player_reconnect: (text, uuid), (text, text)
  - handle_player_disconnect: (text, uuid), (text, uuid, text), (text, text), (text, text, text), (uuid, uuid, text)
  - claim_abandonment: (text, uuid, text), (text, text, text)

- Common CLI pitfalls and remedies
  - --debug can panic due to proxying; avoid unless needed
  - If supabase db push complains about missing remote versions, use --include-all
  - Upgrade CLI when feasible: npm i -g supabase@latest

- Minimal end‑to‑end recovery recipe
  1) Backup (pg_dump) or CSV exports
  2) Reset DB (Studio reset or npx supabase@beta db reset --linked --no-seed)
  3) Apply local migrations: supabase db push --include-all
  4) Verify: SELECT * FROM public.function_type_check; and list pg_proc signatures for target functions

## Current Status (2025-08-15)

### Core Ban Chess Logic - WORKING ✅
The fundamental Ban Chess game mechanics are now functioning correctly:
- Players can successfully ban opponent moves before each turn
- Move execution respects banned moves
- Phase transitions (selecting_ban → making_move) work properly
- State management via Zustand store is synchronized
- Ban Chess checkmate detection properly implemented (king in check with 1 legal move)
- 5 out of 6 Ban Chess core tests are passing

## Previous Updates (2025-08-15)

### Authentication Session Management - NEW ✅
**Feature**: Automatic session validation, refresh, and error recovery

**Problem Solved**: 
- Stale auth sessions showing authenticated UI but failing API calls with 401/406 errors
- Users seeing "permission denied" errors when session expired
- Confusing state where UI shows queue controls but operations fail

**Implementation**:
1. **AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
   - Validates session on mount and every 30 seconds
   - Automatically refreshes expiring sessions (within 60 seconds of expiry)
   - Handles all auth state change events properly

2. **Auth Interceptor** (`src/utils/auth-interceptor.ts`)
   - Centralized 401/406 error handling
   - Automatic session refresh attempt on auth errors
   - Prevents race conditions with singleton refresh promise
   - Redirects to `/auth/login` only when refresh fails

3. **Toast Notifications**
   - "Your session has expired. Please sign in again." (error)
   - "Session refreshed successfully" (info)
   - Queue operation success/failure messages
   - Uses Material-UI Snackbar/Alert components

4. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
   - `invokeWithAuth` automatically retries on auth errors
   - ConnectionContext retries queue operations after refresh
   - `useAuthErrorHandler` hook for consistent error handling

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Session validation logic
- `src/utils/auth-interceptor.ts` - Error handling and refresh
- `src/hooks/useAuthErrorHandler.ts` - Notification integration
- `src/contexts/ConnectionContext.tsx` - Queue operation recovery
- `src/utils/supabase.ts` - Auto-retry for edge functions

### Game Abandonment Detection - COMPLETED ✅
**Feature**: Track and display when players are inactive during their turn

**Components**:
1. **PlayerPresenceIndicator** - Shows real-time player status with:
   - Online/Idle/Warning/Abandoned states
   - Live timer showing time since last activity
   - Visual indicators (colored dots, warning chips)
   - Subscribes to profile updates via Supabase realtime

2. **GamePlayersPanel** - Displays both players' presence in game UI
   - Shows current turn
   - Integrates with game state
   - Identifies spectators

**Database**:
- Added abandonment tracking fields to games table:
  - `abandoned_by`: Which player abandoned
  - `abandoned_at`: When abandonment was detected
  - `abandonment_warning_at`: When warning was issued
- Functions to check and handle abandonment

**Thresholds**:
- Online: Active within 30 seconds
- Idle: 30-60 seconds inactive
- Warning: 1-2 minutes inactive (shows timer)
- Abandoned: 2+ minutes inactive (red warning)

**Integration**: Added to left sidebar in game page

### Row Level Security (RLS) Fix - COMPLETED ✅
**Problem**: Database operations were failing with "permission denied" errors (403 Forbidden)

**Root Cause**: 
- Conflicting RLS policies from multiple migrations
- Overly restrictive policies blocking edge functions despite using service_role
- Policies not properly configured for different roles (anon, authenticated, service_role)

**Solution Applied**: 
Created comprehensive RLS migration (`20251218_comprehensive_rls_fix.sql`) that:
1. Drops all existing conflicting policies to start fresh
2. Creates clean, simple policies for each role:
   - `service_role`: Full bypass of RLS (admin access)
   - `authenticated`: Full CRUD for local development
   - `anon`: Read-only access
3. Grants proper database-level permissions to each role
4. Sets default privileges for future tables

**To Run Services**:
```bash
# Start Supabase (if not running)
npx supabase start

# Start edge functions
npx supabase functions serve

# Start dev server (kills existing process on port 3000)
npm run dev:local
```

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Create test user and get token
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/signup" \
  -H "apikey: [ANON_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpassword123"}'

# Test with authenticated token
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/matchmaking" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"operation":"joinQueue"}'
```

### Ban Move Updates Issue - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Banned moves weren't appearing in the moves list when they occurred

#### The Debugging Journey & Wrong Turns:
1. **Initial Misdiagnosis**: Thought the issue was that the store's `game` object wasn't being updated with PGN
   - Added `store.updateGame(data)` to ban mutation's onSuccess handler
   - Added PGN to ban broadcast payload
   - This partially worked but wasn't the real issue

2. **Discovery of Root Cause**: 
   - The MoveHistoryV2 component was fetching from the `moves` table via RPC
   - Ban records were NOT being inserted into the `moves` table when bans occurred
   - They were only inserted when an actual chess move was made (with the ban info attached)

3. **PGN vs Database Approach**:
   - Original MoveHistory component parsed PGN strings (inefficient, doesn't scale)
   - MoveHistoryV2 uses database queries (much more performant)
   - But MoveHistoryV2 wasn't getting ban data because bans weren't in the database

#### Final Solution:
1. **Edge Function (`supabase/functions/_shared/game-handlers.ts`)**:
   - Modified `handleBanMove` to insert a ban record into `moves` table immediately
   - Ban-only records have empty move fields but populated ban fields

2. **MoveHistoryV2 Component**:
   - Updated to handle ban-only records (no SAN, but has banned_from/banned_to)
   - Displays them with special formatting: "e2e4 banned" with red icon
   - Uses Map for efficient move pairing by move number

3. **BoardMoveInput Component**:
   - Enhanced to accept both formats: "e2e4" and "e2 e4"
   - More flexible input handling for better UX

#### Performance Benefits:
- **Before**: Parsing PGN strings on every update (O(n) string operations)
- **After**: Direct database queries with indexed lookups (O(1) fetches)
- Real-time updates via Postgres triggers instead of string manipulation
- Structured data instead of regex parsing

### Local Game - BROKEN
**Problem**: Local game board renders but clicking doesn't work
**Root Cause**: Incomplete refactoring from old structure to unified store

**Missing Functions** (referenced but not implemented):
- `getLocalPossibleMoves`
- `isLocalMoveBanned` 
- `getLocalGameStatusMessage`
- `selectLocalBan` (exists but references old `localGame` object)
- `makeLocalMove` (exists but references old structure)
- `resetLocalGame`

**Status**: Local game needs complete reimplementation of game logic functions in unified store

### Files Recently Modified
- `src/hooks/useGameQueries.ts` - Fixed hooks ordering, added store updates
- `src/components/MoveHistory.tsx` - Added null safety, improved PGN parsing
- `src/stores/unifiedGameStore.ts` - Added logging, updated local game init
- `src/components/LocalGameBoard.tsx` - Attempted fix but functions missing
- `src/components/LocalMoveHistory.tsx` - Simplified to use MoveHistory component

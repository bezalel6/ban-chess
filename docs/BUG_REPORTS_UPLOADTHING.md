# Bug reports: UploadThing integration and UX changes

What changed
- The bug report dialog now uploads a selected or captured screenshot via UploadThing and includes the returned URL in the report:
  - screenshot_url is still persisted for convenience
  - additional_data.screenshots is populated with an array of URLs (currently max 1)
- The UI copy is friendlier (subject/message) with advanced bug details tucked behind a disclosure.

Files touched
- src/components/BugReportDialog.tsx: integrated UploadThing client hook and revised UX
- src/utils/uploadthing.ts: existing helper used as-is
- src/server/uploadthing.ts and src/pages/api/uploadthing.ts: already present, no changes required

Environment
Add the following to your environment (see .env.example):
- UPLOADTHING_APP_ID
- UPLOADTHING_SECRET

Flow
1) User selects/takes a screenshot
2) Client uploads to /api/uploadthing using route key bugReportScreenshot
3) We receive file.url from UploadThing and include it in:
   - screenshot_url (legacy field)
   - additional_data.screenshots array
4) Report is inserted into public.bug_reports via Supabase

Migration
No DB shape change is required. We only began populating additional_data.screenshots, which is already JSONB.

Notes
- Upload progress is coarse (indeterminate/determinate toggle). UploadThing’s basic generateUploader doesn’t emit granular progress; extend the hook if deeper progress is needed.
- File size is limited to 4MB to match the UploadThing router config.

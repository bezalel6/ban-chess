# UploadThing Optimization Pattern

## Problem
The uploadthing library's `generateReactHelpers` function initiates automatic polling to the `/api/uploadthing` endpoint as soon as it's called at module load time. This causes unnecessary network requests throughout the entire dev server session, even when the upload functionality is never used.

## Solution: Lazy Initialization Pattern

Instead of initializing uploadthing helpers at module load, we use lazy initialization to defer the setup until the functionality is actually needed.

### Before (Eager Loading)
```typescript
// This runs immediately when the module loads
const { useUploadThing: useUploadThingHook } = generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>({
  url: "/api/uploadthing"
});

// Starts polling immediately, even if never used
export const useUploadThing = () => {
  const { startUpload, isUploading } = useUploadThingHook("bugReportScreenshot");
  // ...
};
```

### After (Lazy Loading)
```typescript
// Cache to store the helpers once initialized
let uploadThingHelpersCache: ReturnType<typeof generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>> | null = null;

// Only initialize when actually called
const getUploadThingHelpers = () => {
  if (!uploadThingHelpersCache) {
    uploadThingHelpersCache = generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>({
      url: "/api/uploadthing"
    });
  }
  return uploadThingHelpersCache;
};

// Now only starts polling when the hook is actually used
export const useUploadThing = () => {
  const helpers = getUploadThingHelpers();
  const { startUpload, isUploading } = helpers.useUploadThing("bugReportScreenshot");
  // ...
};
```

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Network Traffic**: No polling requests until the bug report dialog is opened
2. **Better Performance**: Less background activity during development
3. **Cleaner Network Tab**: Easier to debug actual application requests without uploadthing noise
4. **On-Demand Loading**: Resources only consumed when needed

## When to Use This Pattern
Apply lazy initialization for:
- Third-party services that poll or maintain connections
- Features used infrequently (like bug reporting, file uploads)
- Heavy initialization code that's not always needed
- Development tools that shouldn't run in all environments
